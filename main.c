/**
 * In RC_IDLE mode, the CPU is disabled but the peripherals continue to be
 * clocked from the internal oscillator block.
 * This mode allows for controllable power conservation during Idle periods.
 * From RC_RUN, this mode is entered by setting the IDLEN bit and executing
 * a SLEEP instruction.
 * If the device is in another Run mode, first set IDLEN, then clear the SCS
 * bits and execute SLEEP.
 * When the clock source is switched to the INTOSC block, the primary oscillator
 * is shutdown and the OSTS bit is cleared.
 * When a wake event occurs, the peripherals continue to be clocked from the
 * internal oscillator block.
 * After a wake event, the CPU begins executing code being clocked by the INTRC.
 * The IDLEN and SCS bits are not affected by the wake-up.
 * The INTRC source will continue to run if either the WDT or the FSCM is enabled.
