 * Deep Sleep mode brings the device into its lowest power consumption state
 * without requiring the use of external switches to remove power from the device.
 * During Deep Sleep, the on-chip VDDCORE voltage regulator is powered down,
 * effectively disconnecting power to the core logic of the microcontroller.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * Since Deep Sleep mode powers down the microcontroller by turning off the
 * on-chip VDDCORE voltage regulator, Deep Sleep capability is available only
 * on PIC18FXXJ members in the device family.
 * The on-chip voltage regulator is not available on PIC18LFXXJ members of the
 * device family, and therefore, they do not support Deep Sleep.
 *
 * On devices that support it, the Deep Sleep mode is entered by:
 *	- Setting the REGSLP (WDTCON<7>) bit
 *	- Clearing the IDLEN bit
 *	- Clearing the GIE bit
 *	- Setting the DSEN bit (DSCONH<7>)
 *	- Executing the SLEEP instruction immediately after setting DSEN
 *
 * In order to minimize the possibility of inadvertently entering Deep Sleep,
 * the DSEN bit is cleared in hardware, two instruction cycles after having been set.
 * Therefore, in order to enter Deep Sleep, the SLEEP instruction must be executed
 * in the immediate instruction cycle after setting DSEN.
 * If DSEN is not set when Sleep is executed, the device will enter conventional
 * Sleep mode instead.
 * During Deep Sleep, the core logic circuitry of the microcontroller is powered
 * down to reduce leakage current. Therefore, most peripherals and functions of
 * the microcontroller become unavailable during Deep Sleep.
 * However, a few specific peripherals and functions are powered directly from
 * the VDD supply rail of the microcontroller, and therefore, can continue to
 * function in Deep Sleep.
 * Entering Deep Sleep mode clears the DSWAKEL register.
 * However, if the Real-Time Clock and Calendar (RTCC) is enabled prior to
 * entering Deep Sleep, it will continue to operate uninterrupted.
 * The device has a dedicated Brown-out Reset (DSBOR) and Watchdog Timer Reset
 * (DSWDT) for monitoring voltage and time-out events in Deep Sleep.
 * The DSBOR and DSWDT are independent of the standard BOR and WDT used with
 *  other power-managed modes(Run, Idle and Sleep).
 * When a wake event occurs in Deep Sleep mode (by MCLR Reset, RTCC alarm,
 * INT0 interrupt, ULPWU or DSWDT), the device will exit Deep Sleep mode and
 * perform a Power-on Reset (POR). When the device is released from Reset,
 *  code execution will resume at the device?s Reset vector.
